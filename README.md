# Formation_Media_Player
When I used to be a dancer on of the challenges I faced was formations. It's takes a lot of time to visualize everything and get everyone in their spots,and when I did it I used pencil and paper. When I was looking up projects that'll get my ass hired everyone on reddit said to pick a problem you've dealt with and solve it. This is a graphical application that will be used to set formations (and hopefully animate transitions) in time with music. Everything in this application is done using wxWidgets and C++
